## Question

The YouTube video at [Hungarian Folk Dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8) shows Hungarian Kukullomenti legenyes folk dancers implementing a version of QuickSort. Use this video to answer the following questions:

**(a)** Implement the same Quicksort algorithm demonstrated by the folk dancers

**(b)** Generate 10 random array instances with sizes n = 10K, 20K, 30K, 40K, 50K, 60K, 70K, 80K, 90K, 100K. Plot the runtime of your Quicksort algorithm as a function of n. Again, you should put timers to previous and next lines of the line where call Quicksort and then, calculate the difference. Discuss whether the practical plot behaves according to the theoretical complexity.
